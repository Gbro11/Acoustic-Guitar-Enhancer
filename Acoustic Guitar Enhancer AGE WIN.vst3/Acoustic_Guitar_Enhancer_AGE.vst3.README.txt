How to record Acoustic Guitar:  

First find a quiet space to record your guitar. Use a recommended microphone such as the Shure SM57, a small diaphragm condenser such as the Neumann KM184, or Rode NT5, or a large diagram condenser such as the Neumann U87.  

There are multiple ways to capture a good guitar sound but typically a very natural and neutral sound comes from aiming the microphone about a foot or so away from the guitar's 12th fret. To capture a bigger and a harsher sound aim the microphone at the sound hole still about a foot or so away from the source.  

 

The Acoustic Guitar Enhancer plugin has 15 different parameters that you can adjust to create a better guitar sound. 

These 15 parameters include High Cut, Low Level, High, Low, Mid, HighMid. 

Also included is a compressor which has Release, attack Ratio, Threshold, Input Game and Parallel mix. 

It also has a delay which has the feedback delay time and a wet and a dry Parameter.  

 

The plugin is read top down, and the signal flows that same way. The signal goes into the EQ portion of the plugin first then moves into the compressor, where it is then sent through a delay. The EQ has different descriptions of the frequency range it is affecting and each EQ parameter has a sliding scale from –100, to 100 which can be read as percentage. 

The question one can ask themselves is: What percentage of High frequency do I want?  

The compressor works like a typical compressor where one would set their threshold in decibels and then control the ratio from there. The attack and release time are both in milliseconds and the input gain is there if one  would like to add any gain to your signal going into the compressor. The parallel mix allows one to achieve parallel compression with ease by adjusting that parameter.  

The delay only has 4 parameters, feedback which controls how much the delay is feeding signal back into itself. There is also the delay time which is in samples, and finally a dry and a wet parameter to control how much of the affected “wet signal versus how much unaffected dry signal one would prefer.  

If you recorded with a Shure SM57, a Small Diaphragm condenser, or a Large Diaphragm condenser, then the Acoustic Guitar Enhancer has presets custom to those specific microphones to instantly make your guitar sounding better. Simple scroll on the side of the plugin and select the preset menu and select the microphone you used, they will be labeled SM57, SDC, LDC, and NULL. NULL is a preset that normalizes the plugin to reset it if one needs to.
